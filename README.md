# Web-Crawler

Summary for the project: Web Crawler using Python

1. Introduction:
The project involves the development of a web crawler using Python, a program that systematically navigates the internet to gather information from websites. The web crawler automatically extracts data from various web pages, such as text, images, links, or other relevant content.

2. Python Libraries:
The project relies on Python's powerful libraries, such as Requests and BeautifulSoup, to handle HTTP requests and parse HTML content. The Requests library allows the crawler to send HTTP requests to websites, while BeautifulSoup aids in parsing the HTML structure to extract desired information.

3. URL Queue and Crawling Algorithm:
The web crawler employs a URL queue to manage the websites it needs to visit. It starts with a seed URL and then recursively crawls other URLs found on the visited pages. The crawling algorithm ensures that each URL is visited only once, preventing duplicate data retrieval.

4. Data Extraction:
The web crawler identifies and extracts specific data based on predefined patterns or rules during the crawling process. For example, it may extract article titles, product information, or images from the HTML content. The extracted data is stored for further processing or analysis.

5. Robustness and Error Handling:
The project includes measures to handle various scenarios and exceptions that may arise during web crawling. It accounts for different HTTP status codes, connection errors, and unexpected page structures to ensure the crawler runs smoothly and does not break easily.

6. Throttling and Politeness:
To be respectful of the web servers and avoid overwhelming them with requests, the web crawler incorporates throttling and politeness mechanisms. It introduces delays between consecutive requests to prevent excessive traffic from a single source.

7. Data Storage:
Depending on the project's requirements, the extracted data can be stored in various formats, such as CSV files, databases, or JSON files. The storage format ensures that the collected information can be easily retrieved and analyzed later.

8. Configurability:
The web crawler is designed to be configurable, allowing users to set parameters such as crawl depth, allowed domains, and user-agent strings. These configurations provide flexibility and control over the crawling process.

9. Testing and Validation:
Throughout the project, thorough testing and validation are conducted to ensure the web crawler performs as expected. Test cases cover different scenarios and edge cases to verify the crawler's functionality and robustness.

10. Ethical Considerations:
In the context of web crawling, ethical considerations are essential. The project takes care to respect website terms of service, robots.txt files, and any other guidelines set by website owners to ensure legal and ethical data collection.

In conclusion, the web crawler developed using Python provides an efficient and customizable tool for data extraction from websites. By leveraging Python libraries, the crawler navigates the web, extracts relevant data, and stores it for further analysis or usage. Its robustness, error handling, and adherence to ethical considerations make it a valuable tool for various web data harvesting tasks.
